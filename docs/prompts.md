# Example Prompts for GitHub Copilot

## General
- Generate a README.md file for a new project.
- Write a shell script to automate the setup of a development environment.
- Initiate options to provide more context to GitHub Copilot.

## Copilot instructions

- Add me a project.md file in the docs. This file will be used to help copilot with code generation instructions.
- This project is going to be a monorepo. It will contain multiple services in the apps folder. Each service will be structured using clean architecture and will separate clearly commands and queries. The test structure will separate Use cases that contain the application logic and Adapters that aim to interact with boundaries outside the process. Update the project instructions based on this information.
- Don't make the use of commands and queries explicit in the folders. We can place those in the use cases directory.
- Update the project definition so that it will use Kafka and API-first design using OpenAPI specs.

## README

- Update the README file explaining the docs folder and the files in it.
- Update the README explaining that this project represents an e-commerce website. Users can search for products, add products to their basket and then checkout the products paying with their credit card.


## Others
- Add to gitgnore the setup for a java project using maven
