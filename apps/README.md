# Microservices

This directory contains the microservices that are part of the e-commerce platform.

Each service follows clean architecture principles with a clear separation of commands and queries (CQRS) and is structured according to the guidelines in the `docs/project-structure.md` file.

Services will be added here as they are developed.
